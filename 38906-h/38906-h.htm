<h2>ADDRESS OF WELCOME.</h2>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Adams</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">I have been deputed by my fellow-citizens,
of <i>all parties</i>, to bid you a hearty welcome to this
city. I have been directed, Sir, to tender to you the
hospitalities of the people, and of the corporate
authorities of this, and of our young, but flourishing,
sister of Allegheny.</p>

<p class="indent">We have not strewed flowers in your path, nor
erected triumphal arches at your approach, but greet
you with the homage of grateful hearts, as evinced in
this spontaneous outpouring of the people. Here,
Sir, is the token of that universal regard in which
you are held by the free citizens of this great country.
And here, Sir, you have the reward for a long life of
meritorious public service.</p>

<p class="indent">What can be more endearing to the heart of the
patriot, than this exhibition of public sentiment;
than this manifestation of love for your person, and
admiration for your exalted talents and virtues. Like
the son of Marcus Cato, you have been a foe to tyrants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page04" id="page04"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and your country's friend, and that country
now tenders to you the tribute of her affection and
gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">You seem, Sir, &quot;like the aged oak, standing alone
on the plain, which time has spared a little longer,
after all its cotemporaries have been levelled with
the dust,&quot; but the people delight to gather round the
venerable trunk, and dwell beneath the shadow of its
yet green foliage.</p>

<p class="indent">Associated as you have been with the <span class="smcap">Father of
his Country</span>, partaking largely of his confidence, and
deeply imbued with the lofty patriotism of his character,
it must be gratifying to you, to visit this, the
theatre of his earliest achievements.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, standing on the portals of the Mississippi
valley, his prophetic eye reaching far into futurity,
he saw the materials for that great empire, with its
teeming millions, that now revere and venerate his
name. Here it was that Providence thrice spared
his invaluable life. Once, on the Venango path,
when the rifle of the warrior flashed in the pan.
Again, when his frail raft gave way, and he was precipitated
amid ice and snow, and the raging of
the elements, into the rapid waters of the Allegheny.
And again, on the shores of the Monongahela,
when Braddock, and Halket, and Peyronney
fell, by the deadly aim of the French and Indians.
Two horses shot under him, his clothes perforated
with bullets, himself a bright and shining mark, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page05" id="page05"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the leaden messengers were turned aside by an invisible
Hand, and he was saved to lead the armies of his
country to victory, and to lay deep that precious
corner-stone of civil polity, that has no parallel in the
history of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Here it was that in the wigwams, and partaking of
the hospitality of King Shingiss and Queen Allaquippa,
his heart imbibed that warm and active
benevolence for the sons of the forest, that was
so conspicuous in his subsequent administration of
the government.</p>

<p class="indent">Here it was that the influence of his great <span class="smcap">name</span>
suppressed an insurrection that threatened to sap the
foundation of our beautiful political edifice. And
here, Sir, he has a monument in the affection of his
countrymen more durable than brass or marble, and
which will remain steadfast, as long as the rippling
current of the Ohio flows on to the bosom of the
Father of waters.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1798, the first armed vessel that ever floated on
the western waters was constructed here under the
direction of a Revolutionary officer. She was a row-galley,
mounting a solitary gun, and was intended to
protect our infant trade with that splendid domain
afterwards acquired to the Union by the wisdom
and foresight of your illustrious friend and cotemporary,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Jefferson</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">The name of that vessel was the <span class="smcap">John Adams</span>,
And, if tradition is to be credited, after performing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page06" id="page06"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
duty here, she hoisted sails, entered the peaceful pursuits
of commerce, crossed the Atlantic, passed the
straits of Gibraltar, wended her way up the Mediterranean,
threaded the Archipelago, and penetrated
to the Dardanelles on the borders of Asia Minor;
thus carrying on her prow into the very bosom of a
despotic country, the name of one of the honored
actors in the great struggle for Republican liberty.</p>

<p class="indent">Look at the contrast now! Instead of the barge,
and the row-galley, our skilful mechanics in 1843
completed, on the very bastions of old Fort Duquesne,
an iron ship of war that is to carry on the Northern
Lakes the stars and stripes of our beloved country&mdash;and
a frigate is now in progress of construction,
which with her &quot;<i>iron sides</i>,&quot; is destined to defend the
honor of the American name &quot;in every sea under the
whole heavens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When your venerated Sire, with burning zeal, proclaimed
independence <i>now</i>, independence <i>forever</i>;
when, with heroic and inflexible resolution, he signed
his name to the great charter of our liberty, the place
on which you now stand was a barren and unproductive
forest. Now,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;As the swollen column of ascending smoke,&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>so swells her grandeur. From a thousand chimneys
are emitted the living evidences of her prosperity.
The flaming fire, the busy hammer, the revolving
roller, all give daily, hourly proof of her rapid advancement.
Here the rough misshapen elements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page07" id="page07"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
nature are formed and moulded to suit the purposes
of man. Here machines to mitigate the toil of the
laborer, and to facilitate intercourse between the
States, are made with a skill unsurpassed even by the
old world. Here the anchor is forged to give security
and protection to the weather-beaten mariner.
Here the shovel and the mattock, the plough and the
harrow, go forth to ease the labors of the husbandman.
And here the naked are clothed and the
hungry fed, by the evolution of machinery &quot;and the
potent agency of steam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To what are we indebted for all these blessings?
Since the war of the Revolution, to that wise <span class="smcap">TARIFF</span>
policy by which you were regulated when at the head
of the government, and as chairman of the Committee
on Manufactures in the Congress of the United
States. No base subserviency to Foreign Powers dictated
your course, but a manly and determined support
of the true interests of the country, by the protection
of its industry, and by a proper reciprocity
of countervailing restrictions.</p>

<p class="indent">We thank you, Sir&mdash;we thank you with the truest
friendship and the deepest sincerity.</p>

<p class="indent">We honor you for the lustre you have shed on all
the high places it has been your good fortune to
occupy&mdash;we praise you for that sublimest virtue which
shines in all your actions&mdash;we see in your brow that
undaunted valor which renders you inexorably firm in
the discharge of all your public duties, and in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page08" id="page08"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
eye &quot;that inextinguishable spark, that fires the souls
of patriots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Great and good Citizen! Venerable and Venerated
Man! Panegyric or Eulogy, now, or hereafter,
cannot add one cubit to your stature. Live on&mdash;live
on, in honor and in glory&mdash;and when &quot;this corruptible
<i>does</i> put on incorruption, and this mortal,
immortality,&quot; I pray God that it may be in the calm
serenity of that summer's evening, when bonfires and
illuminations light up the land, in commemoration of
that glorious <span class="smcap">INDEPENDENCE</span>, to the achievement of
which your illustrious <span class="smcap">FATHER</span> so largely, so eminently
contributed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>MR. ADAMS' REPLY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">Before I attempt to address you, and to
respond to the eloquent discourse pronounced under
circumstances so unauspicious to eloquence, I must
apologize for my appearance before you.</p>

<p class="indent">I had expected to have had the honor of meeting
you on this day and at this time; and arrangements
were made to render it convenient to yourselves, but
it so happened that the bark on which we had taken
our passage, as if anxious to arrive at the end of her
voyage, and partaking of my feelings, arrived before
the time, when your preparations to receive me were
not completed. My appearance was, therefore, accidental
and unexpected, and as my apology, I would
remind you of the saying of the great Poet of Nature,
Shakespeare, who says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Lovers break not hours,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Except it be to come before their time.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">If the lover is privileged to &quot;break hours&quot; and
&quot;come before his time,&quot; I trust you will accept it as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
my excuse, and impute it to the ardor of a lover
desiring to see the beloved of his soul.</p>

<p class="indent">Fellow citizens! I had motives of the most cogent
nature to inspire me with that feeling, in times past&mdash;I
trust forever&mdash;when my position was anything
but what I find it now&mdash;at a time when I was in a
position of difficulty and danger, I had the gratification
to receive testimonials of regard, respect and
sympathy from the citizens of Pittsburgh, beyond
what I received from any other portion of the United
States, my own constituents and the city of Rochester
alone excepted. I shall always entertain a feeling
of gratitude, belonging to the nature of man,
towards the citizens of Pittsburgh, for their attention
and sympathy on that trying occasion. I had never
flattered myself with the expectation or hope that it
should be in my power to personally return them
those thanks which were due; but they were indelibly
impressed upon my heart&mdash;and it is owing
rather to accidental circumstances that I now enjoy
that satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">During the last summer, I received an invitation
to visit a western city, to perform an act solely connected
with the promotion of science, and totally
separated from politics&mdash;I came for the purpose of
lending my aid to an object for the advancement and
promotion of the happiness of man on earth&mdash;for the
advancement of knowledge, for which I hope all parties
are equally zealous&mdash;the laying of the corner-stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
for an Astronomical Observatory at Cincinnati. I accepted
it, and scarcely had it become publicly known,
till I saw in the public papers a call from some of my
personal friends in this city, to visit and be received
by them on my way to or from the point of my destination.
This reached my ears as coming from personal
friends; by personal friends I mean those who, during
a long life, have approved of my political course
and actions. Of personal friends, strictly speaking,
I have but few among your number&mdash;there are few
in your city with whom I have had the honor of a
personal acquaintance. For this expression of confidence
and this invitation, I felt that gratitude was
due from me.</p>

<p class="indent">But scarcely was that invitation consummated till
a still more comprehensive one, from the citizens of
all the political parties, was given to me. This was
an honor which has never been extended to me before,
and I am not aware that it has been to any
other&mdash;it forms an epoch in our history's history,
and if in any thing I can foresee the voice of posterity,
it is in that!</p>

<p class="indent">In compliance with these invitations, and particularly
the last, I now appear before you. I had intended
to advert to some topics of general interest,
and to the principles which have governed my
course of conduct heretofore, but leaving them to the
judgment of all, and avoiding any thing calculated
to offend any;&mdash;but time will not allow, and the circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
are such that I cannot think of detaining
you here. I must therefore request you simply
to receive the effusions of gratitude from my breast,
applied to each and every one of you. I hope you
will consider those remarks which I intended to have
made, as indicative of the desire which I felt to repay
you in some manner for your attentions towards
me; and I trust that the blessings of a bounteous
Providence may rest upon you individually, and that
the almighty Ruler of the Universe may render
your course, as a community, glorious and happy
hereafter, as it has been honorable heretofore!</p>

<h2>CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Pittsburgh</span>, March 29, 1847.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. John Quincy Adams</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Washington City, D. C.</i>,</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: A day or two after I had the honor of
addressing you at the instance of the citizens of
Pittsburgh and Allegheny, I met you at the hospitable
table of Col. Robinson. To me, and to all
around, the conversation was most entertaining. All
the leading incidents connected with the history of
Western Pennsylvania, from the Whiskey Insurrection
down, seemed to be as familiar to you as to any
native to the &quot;manor born.&quot; I recollect well your
inquiries relating to the honored widow of the author
of &quot;Modern Chivalry,&quot; and how animated you were
in speaking of Captain Farrago and Teague O'Regan.
Cervantes would have laughed and rejoiced at
your association of these western heroes with his
own, and the author felt complimented with your
favorable criticism of a work which he never expected
to reach a second edition.</p>

<p class="indent">Perusing a reprint of the work this evening, it
occurred to me that you might be amused in reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
it, and I have therefore taken the liberty of enclosing
it.</p>

<p class="indent">Trusting that your health is much improved and
that it will continue so,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I have the honor to be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">with the most profound regard,</span><br />
<span class="i4">your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="i4">WILSON McCANDLESS</span>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, 1st April, 1847.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilson McCandless, Esq.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Pittsburgh</i>, <i>Pennsylvania</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I cannot lose a moment before acknowledging
the receipt of your letter of the 29th
ult., and of the valuable present which accompanies
it&mdash;the two volumes of the new edition of Judge H.
H. Brackenridge's &quot;Modern Chivalry, or the Adventures
of Captain Farrago and Teague O'Regan.&quot;
My visit to Pittsburgh in 1843, and my intercourse
with yourself, with the citizens of that place and
Allegheny, at that time, afford me some of the most
pleasing recollections of my life, grateful recollections
of my obligations to yourself and them.</p>

<p class="indent">I had read the first part of Modern Chivalry and
formed a pleasant acquaintance with Captain Farrago
and his man Teague, at their first appearance
more than half a century since, and they had then
excited much of my attention as illustrations of life
and manners peculiar to the times and localities, not
entirely effaced when I became more familiarly acquainted
with them, by this visit to the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Farrago and Teague O'Regan are legitimate
descendants, on one side from the La Mancha
and his squire Sancho, on the other, from Sir Hudibras
and his man Ralph, and if not primitive conceptions
themselves, are at least as lineal in their
descent as the pious Æneas from the impetuous and
vindictive son of Pelias.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
The reappearance of this work, as a second edition,
since the author's death, more than half a century
after its first publication, well warrants the prediction
that it will last beyond the period fixed by the
ancient statutes, for the canonization of poets, a full
century. I shall read it over again, I have no doubt,
with a refreshing revival of the pleasure with which
I greeted it on its first appearance; and if this expression
of my opinion can give any satisfaction to
the remaining relatives of Judge Brackenridge, or
to yourself, it is entirely at your disposal, being
with a vivid sense and grateful remembrance of your
kindness, and that of my fellow-citizens of Pittsburgh
and Allegheny,</p>

<p class="right">Your friend and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">J. Q. ADAMS.</p>

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
